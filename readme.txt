# 👥 User Roles

The system includes multiple roles.

## 👨‍🌾 Farmer

Farmers register harvested herbs and generate traceable batches.

### Farmer Dashboard Modules

Harvest Logging
Creates new herb batches with:

• Herb Name
• Harvest Date
• Quantity
• Farm Location
• GPS Coordinates

QR Code Generation
Each harvest batch generates a **QR code**.

QR contains:

```
/trace/{batchId}
```

Example:

```
/trace/HB-0003
```

---

## 🏭 Supplier

Suppliers receive herbs, process them, package them, and generate product QR codes.

### Supplier Dashboard Modules

#### Receive Batch

Scan farmer QR code to receive herbs.

When scanned:

• Batch is validated
• Stored in supplier inventory

---

#### Processing Log

Manual processing record.

Inputs:

• Herb Type
• Farmer Name
• Quantity
• Processing Method
• Temperature
• Duration
• Yield Percentage
• Waste

Batch is then stored in database.

---

#### Packaging

Generate packets from processed herbs.

Example:

```
10kg batch
packet size = 250g
Total packets = 40
```

Each packet generates a **unique QR code**.

Example packet ID:

```
PKT172891234
```

QR leads to:

```
/trace/PKT172891234
```

---

#### Inventory

Displays all processed batches:

• Batch ID
• Herb Name
• Farmer
• Quantity
• Location

---

## 🧪 Lab

Labs verify herbal quality.

Lab adds:

• Test result
• Certification status
• Verified lab information

---

## 👤 Consumer

Consumers scan QR codes and view full product trace.

Trace page shows:

• Herb Name
• Farmer
• Harvest Location
• GPS Coordinates
• Batch ID
• Supplier
• Processing Details
• Lab Verification

---

# 🧾 QR Code Flow

Farmer QR:

```
/trace/HB-0003
```

Packet QR:

```
/trace/PKT172891234
```

Trace page automatically loads data from MongoDB.
